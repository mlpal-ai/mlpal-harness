### HOP `tools.include`: absent = every tool, `[]` = no tools (2026-10-26)

- `Profile.tools.include` is optional. Absent = every registered tool, and a child HOP that omits it inherits
  its parent's value; `[]` = no tools, so a child writing `[]` overrides a parent's list with none; a list is
  that allowlist. The host filters at use time and warns about names it does not register.
- An enabled module's `tools` merge into `[]` and into a list; with `include` absent the merge is a no-op
  (every tool is already in). So `include: []` with a module enabled resolves to that module's tools, not to
  none; a HOP that wants no tools at all also turns its modules off.
- The builtin `coding` HOP drops `include: []` (its include is now absent, the same toolset as before).
- `describeProfile` leaves an absent `include` out of `HopView.tools`. Protocol 0.22 still types it as
  required; it becomes `include?` at the next protocol bump. No protocol change here.
- MIGRATION: a hop.yaml that wrote `tools.include: []` to mean every tool must drop the key; `[]` now means no
  tools.
